Power and Money are similar.

Without rights, you won't be able to do anything, and will be used by others as if you're merely an object or creature.
So we have Basic Human Rights.
It raises the lowest level of power people can have, ensuring people basic rights at birth (or sometimes before birth, it's fuzzy there).

Money is similar here.
Without money, you won't be able to buy stuff, to support your life.
And similar to human rights raising the minimum level of rights, Minimum Basic Income also will raise the minimum amount of income, ensuring you can support yourself financially, and improve life for poorer people.
With Minimum Basic Income, the lack of money will mean some level of inconvenience, but not to the point where you have to struggle to survive.

I'm no expert in economics, but as far as I can tell, this looks like it'll work.
Without re-balancing the distribution of rights or money, Basic Human Rights and Minimum Basic Income raises the lowest level possible for rights and income, making life of people at the bottom better.


# I got the idea from a line of the main protagonist of 'Children of the Rune I' comparing power and money with each other.
